# About

A project meant to serve as practice of creating a [Lexer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis) in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

It also serves as an excuse to learn more about Elixir and tools used with it, such as [Dialyzer](https://github.com/jeremyjh/dialyxir) and [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/introduction-to-mix.html).

And because the name "Lexer in Elixir" is too good to ignore :)

# Special Thanks

Thanks for [Ryan Winchester](https://github.com/ryanwinchester) for [his work](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/ts-rust-zig-deez/blob/master/elixir/lib/lexer.ex) on making a lexer for the [Monkey](https://monkeylang.org/) programming language.

The lexer work has been insightful to see using idiomatic Elixir and got me to discover some Elixir concepts, such as [guard macros](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#defguard/1) (which I really liked).

There are some concepts that I haven't understood yet, but it's a great read if you want to take a look at some idiomatic Elixir code.

# Contribution

Contributions are welcome, there's no guarantee that your pull request will be accepted as I don't plan on maintaining the repository since this is just a side project.

If you don't mind that and would like to share some advice to the codebase, feel free to submit a pull request with your changes.

I just kindly request you give an explanation of what you're doing and some insight to your code.

# Limitations

I am still learning Elixir bit by bit whenever I feel like it, so there are some things that I haven't practiced a lot, didn't understand, or am not aware of about the language.

So if you find anything that looks wrong or suboptimal, it probably is.
